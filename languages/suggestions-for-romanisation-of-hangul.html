This is great, but I believe the choice of written diphthongs not only make it hard to guess the pronounciation of words, but also make the language look a bit "ugly" to outsiders (in my opinion.) Specifically, I take issue with the fact that "e" is used for some of the written diphthongs. Although I understand the logic of it - if you make an "e" sound (in English) right before the corresponding vowel, you might get something a little close to the Korean pronounciation. However, to a random tourist coming into Korea, they'll probably be very confused and give up guessing the pronounciation. </p><p>What's more is that many people don't even stick to the rules of this Romanisation. I'll often see Korean written in so many different ways - and many Koreans don't know how to convert Hangeul to its Romanised counterpart (who can blame them? Hangeul can be learned in one hour.)</p><p>So how can we fix this? What system could we introduce so that anyone reading romanised Korean could make a better guess of the pronounciation?</p><p>We can keep the current rules more or less the same, but with a few major changes:</p><h3 id="suggestion1useaccentsinsteadofwrittendiphthongs">Suggestion #1: use accents instead of written diphthongs</h3><p>I would suggest first of all to use 'accents,' those which are used in many European languages, to distinguish different vowels. Instead of eo, why not ó (or ò)? We can make some really simple adjustments, as such:</p><ul><li>어 -&gt; ó as in <strong>Ó</strong>lgul (얼굴)</li><li>으 -&gt; ú as in Hang<strong>ú</strong>l (한글)</li><li>외 -&gt; ê as in H<strong>ê</strong>d<strong>ó</strong>pbap (회덮밥)</li><li>애 -&gt; é as in <strong>É</strong>in (애인) <em>(though, to be honest, the currently used "ae" doesn't look so bad)</em></li></ul><p>Of course, the more awkward 의 can become í <em>when it is pronounced as u-i (ɰi)</em> (at the beginning of a word,) but should be e when pronounced like 에 (as a possessive). When pronounced like 이 (in the middle of a word, or at the end when not a possessive, for some dialects) we should retain the í accent just to clear any ambiguity. So,</p><ul><li>의사 -&gt; <strong>Ísa</strong></li><li>송희 -&gt; Songh<strong>í</strong><em>but</em></li><li>나의 -&gt; Na<strong>e</strong></li></ul><h3 id="suggestion2useapostrophesfordoubletenseconsonantsbutonlywhenwrittenintheoriginalhangl">Suggestion #2: use apostrophes for double (tense) consonants, but only when written in the original Hangúl</h3><p>An idea semi-stolen from an older version of Hangúl romanisation (McCune; although in that it was used for aspirated consonants,) we could use something like an apostrophe to signify tense consonants. Simply writing two consonants can look a little awkward in latin characters, and again put off people trying to guess the pronounciation.</p><ul><li>Bballi (빨리) -&gt; B'alli (note ll is not tense, so an apostrophe is not used)</li><li>Jjimjjilbang (찜찔방) -&gt; J'imj'ilbang</li></ul><p>One exception for double consonants is that double "s" should be written as double "s," otherwise things might look a little weird. (했어? -&gt; Haessó? vs. Haes'ó?)</p><h3 id="suggestion3glottalisedbachimshouldwrittenastheircounterpart">Suggestion #3: Glottalised Bachim should written as their counterpart</h3><p>꽃 (flower) becomes G'ot, not G'och. 있다 should be Itda, not Issda (which I've seen written many times.)</p><h3 id="suggestion4onlywritebachimruleswhenthepronounciationchangessignificantly">Suggestion #4: Only write Bachim rules when the pronounciation changes significantly</h3><p>Finally, one of the more difficult concepts of Hangúl: the bachim rules. In Hangúl, the pronounciation of one syllable can change based on the preceeding styllable's <em>bachim</em>. The bachim is basically the last consonant sound of a syllable. Sometimes the rules can get really weird. For instance, 같이, writen as Gati (or kati), is actually pronounced <em>Kachi</em>. This is because, technically, if you were to pronounce each syllable individually as a separate word and glottalised it, the tongue naturally kind of wants to replace that 't' sound with something else (I guess for Koreans it was the 'ch' sound.)</p><p>In these cases, I think the pronounciation should be reflected in the writing, but in other cases, it's not neccessary. Another reason is that bachim rules can be a little ambiguous, some people might implement some rules that others' don't - especially depending on their age and what region they're from.</p><p>So, gati (같이) and gotip (꽃잎) should be written as ga<strong>ch</strong>i and g'o<strong>tn</strong>ip.</p><p>Changes of nasal consonants could also be reflected (e.g ibnida should be written as imnida.)</p><h3 id="suggestion5writeparticlesafteradash">Suggestion #5: write particles after a dash</h3><p>Words can get very very long in Korean. Korean is an <em>agglutinative</em> which means words and grammar particles are added together to make very long words. To help combat this, noun particles/cases/whatever you want to call them should be distinguished with a dash. For exmaple, Nanún -&gt; Na-nún. However, this should be an optional rule.</p><h3 id="examplesentenceusingthenewrules">Example sentence using the new rules</h3><p>Jó-nún Jék Imnida. Hangúl Romanisation-ún munje-ga manhún got gatasó jean-i myótgé issúmnida.</p><p>저는 잭입니다. 한글 romanisation은 문제가 많은 것 같아서 제안이 몇개 있습니다.</p><p>Now I will attempt to write that roughly using the old rules and an educated guess. Uhhh…</p><p><em>Cheoneun Jaekimnida. Hanguel romanisationeun munjaega manheun got kataseo jaeani myeotgae issumnida(?)</em></p><p>Maybe try to show these two sentences to someone who has never seen Korean before, and see which one s/he pronounces more accurately ;) Probably, the one with my suggestions included.</p><p>That's all. I am not a Korean person so I hope I am not butchering the language in any way. But I do think Korean would be a lot less scary to foreigners and tourists if the Romanisation was a little easier to read. Readability is important!</p><p>The end.</p></div></div></div></div><footer><p>Copyright &copy; Jack Penny</p></footer></body></html>
