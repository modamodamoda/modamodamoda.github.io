Well, many things, but one thing stands out above all: they all spend a considerable amount of effort trying to convince the government and general population that they are "the good guys." That their business practices are neccessary, and that their actions are a good force for the world in the long run. The worst thing that I've noticed since the end of <em>Occupy Wall Street</em> all those years ago is that people have started eating this up. The corporate lobby has truly achieved excellence in the last decade. As of late, it seems that people are quite happy to put all of their trust into corporate America. The usual sound of the voices of young adults pushing against corporate greed has been replaced with a cautious acceptance, with anyone refusing to eat the grapes that silicon valley has given us ostracised and branded a weirdo. "People who don't have social media accounts are not to be trusted," I've heard people say. "If you don't believe in Tesla and their mission to save the planet, then you must be a climate change denier!" I've heard from others.</p><p>The PR achievements of corporations do not stop here though. Perhaps the greatest achievement of companies as of late is blaming the consumers for ruining the planet. That is, people seem to believe that the planet dying is a result of their own conscious decisions. If you use plastic, you are damaging the environment, and in some places you even need to pay for the bag. If you buy non-organic food, then you don't care about animals or the chemicals used by modern agriculture to grow crops. Companies have gotten away with murder - literally - by promoting this line of reasoning. Rather than corporations changing their ways, the blame has been placed firmly on the consumers themselves, the ones who buy their products. Of course, the same companies are quite happy to launch other, more ethical product lines, with higher markups. A win-win, they should think. In this age, why are companies allowed to use harmful plastics in the first place? Why are farms allowed to use dangerous chemicals, when their soil is already fertile? </p><p>This consumer guilt, combined by the recent trust in corporations thanks to their friendly marketing and justifications, means that people are quite happy to allow companies to do what they want - trusting that they are eventually acting in a good way, and working towards the betterment of humankind.</p><p>But, this is a fallacy. It's simple: publicly traded companies cannot be ethical. They cannot act in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. They never did, aren't doing so now, and never will. As soon as your fresh new Andreessen-Horowitz funded startup goes on the NASDAQ, they are going to start doing evil things (if they weren't doing evil things already.) Why is this? It's simply because <strong>public companies are acting in the interest of increasing returns for shareholders</strong>. As soon as a stock is traded, the company's performance is measured by its material revenues, or projected revenues. Acting ethically is harmful and affects the bottom line. In some cases where the growth was too fast, it may even lead to bankruptcy. This process can actually start even before a company goes public - in the case of most silicon valley companies, they are already answering to a large group of private investors and are not necessarily given full autonomy over their company's moral actions.</p><p>No matter how much a company will try to convince you, you have to remember that they will always be acting in bad faith. Every decision they make will end up being made for the shareholders - this is because that a company must keep growing. The share price must increase. Forever. And in order to do that it needs to start compromising on the company's original ethical values (if it had any in the first place.) This is because ethical decisions are often expensive. Using higher quality and/or biodegradable materials will eat into the profit margins. Taking more care into the craft of putting a product together means more money spent on labour. In the case of social media services, educating consumers on the dangers of their service or limiting their time would lower engagement and thus ad revenue. If TikTok or Instagram stopped people from "influencing" - which is extremely damaging to the self-esteem of impressionable women (and even men) in many ways - it would place a huge risk on profits.</p><h3 id="anidealworld">An ideal world</h3><p>In an ideal world, companies would run in an ethical manner. Many of them are already deep in profit - and the search for even larger profits should probably stop at some point, and the company can focus on prioritising its original values and making the world a better place. Of course, this is a fairytale, companies need to keep acting in the interest of its stock price. In reality, do companies <em>actually</em> need to increase their stock price 10%, year-on-year? Absolutely not. Do companies <em>really</em> need to achieve 80% market share? Nope. The actual profit of these companies doesn't even go anywhere. A company could just make enough profit to save for a rainy day (like a recession) and it would be perfectly fine. They just need to provide a good service and/or product to consumers, while acting in an ethical manner.</p><p>There is another interesting aspect to this: the actions of a public company are a zero-sum game. The end recipients of a stock's performance are individuals. The individuals want the stock price to go up so that they can grow their wealth and retire comfortably (or make quick gains - either/or.) These individuals may actually have moral values themselves, but they probably care less about the environment than securing a safe retirement in uncertain times. However, a company cannot act in an ethical way that benefits humankind and the planet - because doing so will cause a stock's performance to suffer. If the stock performance suffers, many of the shareholders, many of the recipients of value growth being average joes, who generally act ethically in their day-to-day lives, suffer also. Thus, the stock is dumped in favour for a competitor who is more cut-throat and willing to put profit first.</p><p>This is an interesting point, because it suggests that even if the vast majority of people are ethical in a free capitalist society, they will still act in their own interest when it comes to investment decisions, meaning that companies will still act in the interest of profit no matter what.</p><h3 id="sowhatcanwedoaboutit">So, what can we do about it?</h3><p>Government intervention seems to be the most effective way. The EU passes many laws which fundamentally prevents companies operating in the EU to do certain unethical things. However, this type of intervention is too weak. There are usually loopholes, which corporations are quite happy to use. I heard a story from a friend recently about how a large corporate landlord used a loophole in his city that allows houses to be sold beyond their government-enforced price cap if they do renovations. Of course, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to guess that they probably sub-divided old flats into poor quality dry-wall filled modern cages and sold them for a wicked profit.</p><p>Another thing that impedes effective government intervention is corporate lobbying. As stated in the first few paragraphs, corporations are very good at convincing people and the government that they are acting in an ethical manner. They will make excuses for their behaviour, or they will trick governments into creating loopholes in newly created laws. Using the above example, a justification might go like - "oh, a lot of our apartments are old so perhaps we can convince corporate landlords to renovate them for us for free while keeping housing affordable." Well, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/blackstone-rebellion-how-one-country-worlds-biggest-commercial-landlord-denmark">it didn't work like that</a> in the end - there is no good faith when it comes to corporations.</p><p>The only government that could truly win at this is one that rules with an iron fist, and charges severe penalties for companies who act unethically. But then, ethics is fluid - what is ethical for me may not be ethical for everyone, certainly a government, which are generally fragile structures.</p><p>Another option is state capitalism. State-owned corporations tend to act in the interest of its people, and oftentimes the planet too. The best example of this is state-owned rail companies in Europe. They are often efficient - fast - and the tickets are affordable for most. They move slowly, they are not disrupting anything, but at least you know that when you travel by rail in Europe you are serving the interests of the common people. Ethical governments, such as those in Europe, are also careful to place rail lines in a way that doesn't disrupt the environment too much. </p><p>Finally, drawing shareholders away from unethical companies seems to be the recent method. You often see sovereign wealth funds such as Norway's pulling out of companies that are doing things they are believe are "unethical." However, the vast majority of other individuals are happy to buy a stock which acts in the interests of profit. At the end of the day, most people won't put their money where their mouth is.</p><p>In my own opinion, perhaps a total ban on corporate lobbying and "donations" (which I like to call bribes) should be called for. People need to know the truth.</p><h3 id="peoplewillalwaysfindjustification">People will always find justification</h3><p>In the end, people will always give into their biases and allow for flawed reasonings to make them feel better about a certain company. Silicon valley is always coming up with justifications for its actions - and even the mere existence of their psychologically damaging services, for instance. And we want to believe it too - because being able to spend a lot of time staring at a small box scrolling through your Facebook or TikTok feed is fun. When commodity prices soared in the wake of the Ruso-Ukraine war, fossil fuel companies - arguably the most evil of them all - managed to convince us that they <em>had</em> to drive up their prices to the point that they did. Post pandemic inflation is another thing - "sorry guys, but it's just too expensive right now," they say while they report record profits and higher profit margins. There is some ounce of trust in most of these justifications, but mostly they are simply lies. </p><p>Last year, when an economist published a 50-page study suggesting that maybe recent inflation was actually mostly a result of corporate greed and a desperate attempt at get company earnings back on track for records after covid - <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/18/once-a-fringe-theory-greedflation-gets-its-due">it was laughed at</a>. But now, central banks and governments are taking this very very seriously and scrambling to cool things down without doing more damage to the consumer economy, which is kept hostage by wall street. Well, what do you know, they lied again.</p><p>In conclusion, I have but one very simple thing to say: Publicly traded companies are evil. That's that.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="container"><div id="contact"><h2>Contact</h2><form id="ms" onsubmit="return sendMail()"><input type="hidden" name="name" value="User" /><input type="hidden" name="l" value="https://jackpenny.com/" /><p><input id="email" name="email" type="text" placeholder="Your E-Mail" /></p><p><textarea id="summary" name="summary" placeholder="Your Message"></textarea></p><p><button type="submit" class="submit">Submit Message</button></p></form></div></footer></body></html>
