# E-Resume

### Who am I?
My name is Jack Penny. I am a computer programmer with a systems background who eventually moved to web development - but now I do both! This resume will be a little unorthodox, but as someone who is entirely self-taught, it's a little difficult to write a traditional one.

### Programming skills
I have a great command of the languages listed below, ordered by years of experience notated in the form of `personal/professional years`.
 - C/C++ (14/8 years)
 - JavaScript (12/8 years)
 - Perl (7/7 years for the old school companies out there)
 - PHP (11/8 years...should I really mention this on my resume?)

### Design skills
I am also reasonably skilled as design, having worked countless hours in photoshop doing mockups for some clients. Note however that design is not my main forte, but if you are short a designer for a project I'm sure I can help out. I have been using Photoshop for 10 years now. Time sure moves fast.

### Linux skills
I have been using a linux terminal in some form almost every day for the past 10 years (except weekends.) I would say my linux skills are great - but please don't ask me to do any kernel programming.

### Hobbies
 - Music
   * Easily my biggest hobby by far. I have been producing electronic music since the age of 15, which is around 12 years now, and playing guitar for 7 years. Although it's probably not useful for job applications, I have studied harmonic theory intensely and also have good command of that. Who knows, maybe you do marketing too and need commercial music?
 - Linguistics
   * I love to study languages. I speak English, Korean and Mandarin. I'm currently studying Japanese and looking to take my TOPIK 2 (Korean) and HSK 4 (Mandarin) proficiency tests so that I can include those in my resume as a professional skill. I used to speak Spanish but got lazy and stopped speaking it. If there are any Spaniards in your company, I would love to practice with them.

### School
Possibly my biggest weakness in the eyes of many employers - I am not traditionally educated. I never entered university. I started learning programming at the age of 10, as I wanted to create my own computer game. At the age of 12 I found C++ and kept cracking on it until the age of 19 when I finally started working as a professional freelancer in web development.

### Work Experience
I have been working as a full time professional freelancer for 8 years. I started working with web development - in particular PHP (WordPress, etc) before moving onto more complex e-commerce projects. The majority of my work now is centered around ERP systems. I am using Perl most of the time as many of these systems are quite dated and clients do not wish to rebuild their systems from scratch.

### Personal Projects/Portfolio
Working in a business-to-business environment unfortunately my portfolio of professional work is very small. So instead, I can show you my personal projects! Don't worry, as an obsessive programmer they have been written to the same degree of quality. See below for github links.
1) Blockchain, implemented in C (includes proof of work algorithm.)
