There will be periods in my life, often lasting for months, in which I will have episodes on a near-daily basis which cause me to lose my ability to rationalise leading to extreme fear and debilitating physiological symptoms. This is known as panic disorder. For those who don't know, panic disorder is a mental disorder which causes you to have frequent panic attacks. In my case, I will have some kind of fixation (a "fear",) which is usually irrational but based on some kind of real possibility (albeit an extremely small one,) which causes me to ruminate over and over causing panic attacks in the process. Then, the panic attacks themselves become scary, and I get afraid of those too. This starts a viscious cycle which always seems never ending.</p><h2 id="whatisapanicattack">What is a panic attack?</h2><p>I'm sure in 2020 everyone has heard of them by now. They are becoming a very common occurence in today's decadent society, and cases of panic attacks have skyrocketed even more during the covid pandemic. But if you're still unsure, basically during a panic attack your mind goes into overdrive - causing you to freak out beyond rationality - which in turn causes physiological symptoms brought on by the body's flight or fight response. Suddenly adrenaline, which is supposed to be an essential tool for human survival, becomes your worst enemy as it causes you to hyperventilate, freeze up, and seemingly lose control of your ability to rationlise things.</p><h2 id="panicdisordermystory">Panic disorder: my story</h2><p><em>tl;dr: panic disorder sucks, and unless you want to read a piece of my life story, feel free to skip to the next section, as this one is 95% venting</em></p><p>I still remember my first panic attack. I was 15 at the time. I was lying in bed trying to sleep, and I thought I felt my heart skipping a beat. This caused me to think I was dying of some kind of rare heart condition - prompting me to rush downstairs and scream at my mother to call an ambulance. Now, you should know the panic disorder often runs in families - and oh boy does it run in mine. She calmed me down and said "you're having a panic attack" - she knew what it was immediately. Then she told me to go outside and take a walk. I slowly calmed down, while hyperventilation ensued. It took me a good 3-4 hours for the hyperventilation to calm down before I could get to sleep. After that, I had another one a few days later while laying in bed watching the movie <em>40 days and 40 nights</em>, which was Channel 4's saturday night movie. I have such clarity in my memory of those first couple of panic attacks, but after that it gets blurry. All I know is I had a panic attack almost every other day for a few months after that first one, before they calmed down. By the end of it I had gotten so used to, and bored of them, that they stopped bothering me and thus ceased being panic attacks.</p><p>Things went quiet in my mind for a while after that. I would have panic attacks still, but they'd be mild. More often I'd just get the hyperventilation part - which is annoying in itself. Infact even to this day I might start hyperventilating and/or having mild panic attacks out of nowhere. It's worth noting during these attacks, which psychiatrists call <em>limited symptom attacks</em>, I'm completely in control (of my mind, at least.)</p><p>It wasn't until 6 years later, when I was 21, that I had full blown panic disorder again. This time the fixation was different - <em>psychosis</em>. I had become very afraid that I might develop schizophrenia one day after watching movies like <em>a beautiful mind</em>. Now, it wasn't like I was trying to compare myself to John Nash or anything like that, but it made me think. Of course, consulting of Dr. Google ensued shortly thereafter and especially after reading it can appear at any time in your youth and there's a 1% chance of getting it - I started to freak. Suddenly I started getting some very interesting anxiety symptoms including <em>micropsia</em> (a condition where objects are perceived smaller than they actually are,) which is a symptom of dissociation. Dissociation was a whole new game - and I can't even explain the symptoms with words. Micropsia is just one of many strange symptoms I'd encounter. Although none of them caused me to have hallucinations, or anything related to psychosis, it certainly made me panic. This panic lasted a good 6 months before it subsided, and the dissociation lasted even longer - perhaps for a year or so. It occured to me at this point that perhaps anxiety likes to take on the form of whatever your deepest fear is at the time. I worry about my heart, and I'll start hearing skipped heartbeats; I worry about my mind, and I'll start having strange dissociative symptoms.</p><p>I thought I finally got rid of my panic after that. In-fact, I was pretty proud of it, and often find myself giving advice to others who seem to be inflicted with panic disorder. Then it started to happen again. For most of last year, I was fortunate to have gotten stuck in Vietnam. Despite a couple of short lockdowns, they have been one of the few success stories of covid - simultaneously keeping cases extremely low and even growing their GDP. However, the problem was that I had nothing to do there. The expat community in Vietnam likes to party, so I started partying. A lot. At least 2-3 times a week. The alcohol consumption combined with being with other people at almost all times really drained me to the point that I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. While shopping in a supermarket, I lost control of myself and collapsed on the floor, barely able to speak. I reached out for my phone to try and call an ambulance, but my hands were shaking - so I screamed at some staff members asking them to do it for me (of course I could barely string a word together.) It was a highly embarrassing ordeal. It ended with me getting a ride to the hospital only to find, after an ECG and CAT scan, that I was fine.</p><p>This time I was scared of dying of a sudden heart attack - and because the panic attacks themselves were so bad, I thought they themselves were episodes originating from my heart. The next month or so were very difficult as I kept having panic attacks that would push my heart rate above 150bpm. I have to say, it might have been one of the worst times in my life, if not the worst (but then again, I probably thought that the previous time too.) Driving yourself to the hospital every other day in 35C heat isn't fun. Even worse is the shame when doctors continually tell you you're fine. I eventually gave in and came back to the UK, thinking it might calm me down. It did a little bit, but not completely. The panic attacks continued until Christmas. The cure? It was quite simple, don't drink <em>at all</em>, and give myself a good chunk of alone time. That, and a little bit of time (well, not a little bit, about 6 months.) Just like that I am fine again, and haven't had a severe panic attack in weeks.</p><h2 id="okayokayenoughaboutyouhowdoesonedealwithrecurringpanicattacks">Okay okay, enough about you, how does one deal with recurring panic attacks?</h2><p>In the end, I manage to get over it every time. My theory is that I just get so bored of them, and used to them, that they become insignificant. As long as, and this is super important, you don't let the panic attacks <em>own</em> you, you should be fine in time. This might be my coping mechanism (<em>time</em>,) but it doesn't work for everyone. Some people are able to use some techniques to speed up the process, but some are so afraid of their panic attacks that they go onto develop life-debilitating conditions like agoraphobia.</p><h3 id="alistofthingsivetried">A list of things I've tried</h3><p>I'm going to put this list into 3 sections. After 13 years of on-and-off panic disorder, I've probably tried almost everything (I actually haven't tried therapy yet, which is probably the most effective, you can't beat a good psychiatrist.)</p><p>Note that this list is <em>very personal</em>, just because it didn't work for me, it doesn't mean it won't work for you. And just because it did work for meâ€¦you get the idea.</p><h3 id="didntwork">Didn't work</h3><p><em>Meditation</em></p><p>At least to the level I learned it. Quieting the mind, being mindful - all that stuff is great, but I knew I was still thinking about stuff and worrying about it, the thoughts just went deeper into a place where I couldn't hear them - and instead they became intuition. I'd rather have my thoughts in my inner monologue, thanks.</p><p><em>Yoga</em></p><p>Yoga worked for a little bit. It really helped me control my breathing - for a little while, and I still use some techniques to this day. But after even only 2-3 weeks of Yoga, I guess my mind got used to it and it stopped being effective, as if my panic had gained some kind of 'tolerance.' Note that I was mostly learning from Youtube videos, so a real teacher might have been more effective.</p><p><em>Medication</em></p><p>I never got on the benzos, but I was prescribred SSRIs for a while. They can certainly help, but they don't really address the issue. In order to fix panic attacks, you have to address the deep issues. Perhaps medication can help keep anxiety low as you work through your issues. But personally my approach is to face issues like this head on. I'd rather not run away - however painful it is. Perhaps I'm a masochist?</p><h3 id="workedabit">Worked a bit</h3><p><em>Working out</em></p><p>I never went to the gym to work out, only doing it at home with body weight exercises. Working out can be great, but if the panic is high, the effects of working out (higher heart rates, strain, etc) can cause your anxiety to get worse in the short term. But if you can stick to it, it will benefit you in the long run for sure.</p><p><em>Exposure therapy</em></p><p>Forcing yourself to deal with your fears work great for some people. And I'm sure I've used this technique for some fears - but when the fears are quite far off into the deep end, it's difficult to enage in them. You can use exposure therapy on the panic attacks youself - trying to force yourself to accept your fate, acept everything, when a panic attack comes on; but it can be extremely difficult. I was never able to fix my panic attacks this way, but I've read many people have on the ol' anxiety message boards.</p><p>How exposure therapy <em>can</em> work very effectively for me (and maybe you too) is forcing yourself into your triggers. As you get more and more panic attacks your mind will start to make associations. You might start having a lot of panic attacks in malls, and associate malls with panic attacks. So the answer? Go into a damn mall every day and spend a good hour there until you realise they can't harm you.</p><h3 id="gamechangers">Game changers</h3><p><em>Breathing techniques</em></p><p>Breathing techniques can really help when you're in control. They can help get a bout of hyperventilation under control. In some cases, when fear is too high, it won't work very well. Also, in cases of chronic hyperventilation, it often comes back as soon as you stop focussing on your breathing so much. I guess it only works about 50% of the time for me, but it's still a game changer, as hyperventilation causes many of the physiological symptoms.</p><p><em>Thought mindfulness (?)</em></p><p>I have no idea what this is called, but I got it from a book called "overcoming unwanted intrusive thoughts." Basically, the idea behind it is that when you start panicking, there are often two thought processes in your head arguing with each other. One side will be hinting at negative possibilities (you're going to die, you could have heart disease, etc) and the other will be trying to console you (nahhh that's very unlikely, it has X Y symptoms which you don't have, etc.) The idea behind the technique in this book is that you accept the consoling "voice" is just as bad as the negative one - they are both perpetuating the worries. So in this case, you just accept them and say something to yourself like "I see you two arguing, go ahead but I won't let it get to me." It works pretty damn well for specific types of panic attack - so I'd definitely recommend giving the book a read.</p><p><em>CBT</em></p><p>Although I never tried CBT with a therapist, I learned to do it on myself and it is extremely effective in helping you take control of your thoughts. There are many approaches to this, but I recommend the <a href="https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/">Get Self Help guide</a>.</p><p><em>Walking. A lot</em></p><p>I started going for walks when I was 17 to deal with some anxiety I had then. I would walk a good 1-2 hours each day, just listening to music and enjoying the hills that surrounded where I lived. Sometimes I would even skip and walk the 1-2 hours each way to "high school" (we call it college in the UK.) Walking is really amazing. It's also essential to making sure you don't get stuck indoors and end up with agoraphobia.</p><h2 id="addressingdeeperissues">Addressing deeper issues</h2><p>At the end of the day, panic attacks are usually a manifestation of something deeper. I like to think of anxiety as a kind of stack:</p><ol><li>Genetic disposition (to having panic attacks)</li><li>Deep issues (this could be anything from childhood trauma to mental idiosyncrasies developed early or even later in life)</li><li>Interim issues (this could be things actively stressing you out - work, isolation from home, study, etc)</li><li>Active environment (this is the triggers in active environment, which you usually start to avoid)</li></ol><p>A lot of the really deep issues are developed early in life, or due to a traumatic experience. These generally should be talked through with a psychiatrist as it's very hard to dig deep on your own. This is something I myself have been putting off and will need to do eventually, hopefully sooner rather than later.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning is that the genetic disposition can be very strong. In my case, I think I have a rather strong disposition as panic attacks can come on even in periods of my life when I (at least think that I) am happy. </p><h2 id="lastbutnotleastandmostimportantlyifyoudontbowtothepanicattackstimehealsallwounds">Last but not least, and most importantly, if you don't bow to the panic attacks, time heals all wounds</h2><p>If you don't allow the panic attacks to own you, you will be okay. Think of your anxiety like an enemy which you must resist. Not neccessarily defeat - that creates inner pressure. But at least resist. Be resilient. Be proud every day you get through a panic attack. Another day retaining your sanity is another day towards those pesky attacks finally leaving you alone. Sometimes all techniques seem completely helpless, but time is always on your side - and after a while, they'll go away <em>as long as you always resist</em>. I promise. </p><p><a href="https://jackpenny.com/">&laquo; Back home</a></p></div></div></body></html>
